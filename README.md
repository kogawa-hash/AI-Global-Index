# AI-Global-Index

Introduction:

In this project, we will be examining the nuanced landscape of AI adoption across developed countries. We have three data-sets from Kaggle: the AI Global Index, AI Companies Data-set, and a general countries information set. Our curiosity lies on the relationships between AI adoption metrics and the presence of AI companies. We aim to craft visuals that capture the patterns in AI usage and explore various AI companies. And hopefully by the end of the project, we can uncover insights that contribute to the broader narrative of AI innovation on a global scale.

Literature Review:

AI has recently seen an explosion of development and adoption around the world. In the past decade, AI can now perform even better than humans on speech and image recognition tasks, the computational power used to train AI has increased from tens of petaFlops to tens of billions of petaFlops, and investments in AI have increased by over 1000%. Given the potential power of AI, it is imperative for countries to adopt it as soon as possible so they donâ€™t fall behind. Yet more than 90% of the hardware for AI is designed and manufactured in only a handful of countries: the United States, Taiwan, China, South Korea, and Japan. It is important to look into these patterns in AI development so that we can better understand and promote the development of fair, safe and effective AI around the world.

Goals:

Nations with certain geographical regions will exhibit similar patterns in AI index scores and the concentration of AI companies. This corresponds to our goal of investigating whether there is a regional influence of the level of AI adoption. Our next hypothesis is that countries with higher government commitments to AI will have higher AI Index scores. This correlates to another goal of exploring the relationship between government commitment to AI (Government Strategy indicator) and the overall AI Index scores.
